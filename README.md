# MyPython
My Internship project is on Employee Management System
This project is based on the below guidelines 

Part1:
Create an hierarchy of classes- abstract class Employee and subclass HourlyEmployee,SalariedEmployee,Manager and Executive.
Every one's pay is calculated differently.
After successful establishment of an employee hierachy, create a Company class that allows us to manage the employees. 
Must be able to hire, fire and raise employees.

Part 2:
Using Tkinter, I have added & removed employee, added manager and made the data for every employee visible.
